I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the UNC Institute for the Environment, where my research focuses on issues related to urban water quality, stormwater infrastructure, and impacts of climate change.  

I earned by bachelors degree in Environmental Science with a minor in Marine Science from UNC Chapel Hill's Environment, Ecology, and Energy (E3P) program in the spring of 2015.  After graduation, I joined Dr. Michael Piehler's lab as a graduate student in the E3P program researching the effects of urban development on stream water quality in the NC Coastal Plain. I graduated with a PhD in Ecology in December 2020.

To learn more, check out my ongoing projects that focus on nutrient cycling in stormwater ponds and measuring/modeling the impacts of recurrent coastal flooding.
